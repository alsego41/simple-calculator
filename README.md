# A Simple Calculator

Now made with React!

## Known Issues

1. Sometimes some operators remain in the display. Eg. 567^2^2 -> el resultado a mostrar es 321489^2

## Future Updates / Improvements

- Set a maximum to how many decimals can be displayed ??? (This can be a bad approach but at the same time it is a 'simple' calculator).
- After the obtantion of a result, if an operator is pressed it will be added, but if it's another number it will be added as a new count. ??? (Maybe this isn't necessary).
- Change display colors on click / hover.
- Add a copy icon to both displays.
- Some operations will not take place, but remains after showing the results. This is cause due to not having the right validations before doing a calculation. See #1 K.I.
