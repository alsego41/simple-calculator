# A Simple Calculator

Now made with React!

## Known Issues

1. Sliders lack compatibility in most browsers.
2. Calculator must be able to recognize high numbers expressed with e (number * 10^x).
3. A number with multiple periods results in a NaN, which is okay, but it should display 'Syntax error'.
4. When trying to get a result from a single number, the display will show a 0.

## Future Updates / Improvements

- Can / should I disabled zoom function on mobiles?
- When only a number is displayed, and I want to do its square root, the square root should be add before the number, not as it's now (after).
- Optionals buttons to add -> Ans, e, x!.
- Add support for Mac paste -> cmd + v.
- Enable mobile pasting.
- Fixing of Known Issues.
