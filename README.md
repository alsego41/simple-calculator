# A Simple Calculator

Now made with React!

## Known Issues

2. Some operations like 4^2^2 would be resolve as normal when in reality this shouldnt be possible. Also it's no possible to make a multiplication between two negative numbers.

## Future Updates / Improvements

- Set a maximum to how many decimals can be displayed ??? (This can be a bad approach but at the same time it is a 'simple' calculator).
- After the obtantion of a result, if an operator is pressed it will be added, but if it's another number it will be added as a new count. ??? (Maybe this isn't necessary).
- Change display colors on click / hover.
