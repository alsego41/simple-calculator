# A Simple Calculator

Now made with React!

## Known Issues

- Every operation other than + and - will result in an error.

## Future Updates / Improvements

- Set a limit or an scroll to display so it wont change its size.
- Clean the display when an operator is introduced ??? (Depends on how calculations will be revamped).
- Add funcionality to advanced buttons. (Part of the revamp).
- Set a maximum to how many decimals can be displayed ??? (This can be a bad approach but at the same time it is a 'simple' calculator).
- After the obtantion of a result, if an operator is pressed it will be added, but if it's another number it will be added as a new count. ??? (Maybe this isn't necessary).
- Symbols interpretation. (Part of revamp).
